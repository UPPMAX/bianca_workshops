Sometimes the instructions on the course page were a little hard to follow with a lot of pointing to other pages (understandable, to not have duplicate information) and similar information repeated (first as principles, then as step-by-step-instructions). But other than that it was a pedagogic and helpful course!
It's a very good and detailed seminar and teachers are very nice and give many useful tips. Highly recommend !
