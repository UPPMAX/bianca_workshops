    Lesson plan:

    ```

    As the video is 11 minutes, I assume around 3x as much time.

    Prior questions:

    - What is file transfer?
    - Could you give an example of a file transfer you do in daily life?
    - Does it have consequences that Bianca is a sensitive data cluster?
    - How does one do file transfer on Bianca?

    Polls (goal: part of prior and measure actual usage):

    My favorite way to transfer files to/from Bianca now is using:

    - FileZilla
    - fuse-sshfs and mounting the wharf
    - lftp
    - rsync
    - scp
    - sftp
    - sshfs and mounting the wharf
    - Rclone
    - WinSCP
    - other

    About rsync:

    - I have never followed a lecture on rsync, I don't know what it is
    - I have never heard a lecture on rsync, but I've never gotten it to work
    - I have never heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice
    - I have never heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, and use it
    - I have heard a lecture on rsync, but I've never gotten it to work
    - I have heard a lecture on rsync, I have gotten it to work, but don't use it in practice

## Why?

`rsync` allows you to transfer files from anywhere to anywhere
securely, unlike, for example, FileZilla.

In this session, we will transfer (non-sensitive) files to/from Bianca
to/from you local computer, as this is more convenient for teaching.
Imagine, however, that you transfer from Bianca to/from another
sensitive data HPC center.

## Terms

    sftp_server <--> user
  end
```

As Bianca is a sensitive data cluster, we need to know:

- [wharf](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/wharf/): a folder
  on Bianca that is the only folder one can transfer data to/from
- [Transit](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/transit/):
  a service that allows one to transfer files between Bianca
  and other places, such as your local computer,
  but also other sensitive data clusters.
- `rsync`: a tool to transfer files via Transit
- FileZilla: a tool to transfer files via an SFTP server (whatever that is)

## Software

There are many ways to [transfer files to/from Bianca](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/transfer_bianca/).

In this session, we use:

- [File transfer to/from Bianca using rsync](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_rsync/):
  the recommended way to do so
- [File transfer to/from Bianca using FileZilla](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_filezilla/):
  the user-friendly way to do so

We will use `rsync` first, as this is the UPPMAX-recommended way,
as it is capable of transferring files of any size efficiently.

FileZilla is easier to use and its guide is easier to go through
without an UPPMAX expert.

## Exercises

Exercise 1 and 2 are the most important, as:

- `rsync` is the recommended tool
- it is harder, so do it with an UPPMAX expert around!

### Working form

You'll be assigned to Zoom breakout rooms with at least 3 learners in total.
The Zoom rooms will be closed automatically at the end
and stay open during the break.

???- question "Why put us in groups?"

    Because group work in general is effective for learning
    (see `[1]` for a meta-meta analysis).
    For online courses, group work is a recommended practice
    `[Bigatel & Edel-Malizia, 2018][Means, 1993]`.

???- question "What if I have a question?"

    Ideally, one asks the people in the breakout room.
    In that way, the whole room may learn.

    Additionally, there is a shared document you can use, you can ask for help
    via a Zoom function and teachers and teaching assistants will regularly
    go through all rooms.

???- question "Why have a break in between?"

    Because breaks are important for learning `[Newport, 2016]`.
    Please take that break, ideally by doing something boring `[Newport, 2016]`!

### Exercise 1: first understanding of how to use `rsync`

???- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Explore the UPPMAX documentation
    - Understand what the wharf is
    - Understand what the Transit server allows

- As a group, agree on how to start, for example to agree
  to first read the exercises
- Scan the content of [the UPPMAX documentation on how to use rsync to transfer data to/from Bianca](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_rsync/)
- Answer the following questions to yourself in your own words (answers are below).
  Be generous in accepting your own answer.
  You may share your answer in the course shared document for feedback,
  but do not wait for feedback.
  If you have no idea at all, read the linked UPPMAX documentation:

    - What is [SUNET](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/get_inside_sunet/)?
    - What is [`ssh`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/ssh/)? What does it allow us to do?
    - What is [`wharf`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/wharf/)? What does it allow us to do?
    - What is [`rsync`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/rsync/)?
    - What is [`transit`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/transit/)?

???- question "Answers"

    > - What is SUNET?

    [SUNET](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/get_inside_sunet/) is the university networks (yes, plural!).

    > - What is `ssh`? What does it allow us to do?

    [`ssh`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/ssh/) is an SSH client
    that allows us to log in to Bianca and Transit

    > - What is `wharf`? What does it allow us to do?

    [`wharf`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/wharf/) is a folder
    on Bianca used for file transfer to/from Bianca.

    > - What is `rsync`?

    [`rsync`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/rsync/) is a command-line tool
    to transfer files to/from Bianca.

    > - What is `transit`?

    [`transit`](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/transit/)
    is an UPPMAX service that can be used to securely transfer files.

### Exercise 2: using `rsync`

???- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Explore the UPPMAX documentation
    - Mount the wharf on Transit
    - Transfer files to/from Bianca using rsync

This exercise is quite practical.
Therefore, one interruption is scheduled for those that are stuck.

Here is what to do when you get stuck:

1. Take a look at the YouTube video that can be found at that page
   **until the point where you are stuck**, then go back to using
   the UPPMAX documentation again
1. Ask your question in the shared document.
   Raise your hand or contact the teachers in any way.
   You will be put in a Zoom room and the question in the document will be answered together

Here is the exercise:

- Follow the step-by-step guide of
  [the UPPMAX documentation on how to use rsync to transfer data to/from Bianca](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_rsync/).
  There are 4 transfers described (file versus folder, upload versus download),
  do at least 1 upload and 1 download
- Signal in Zoom that you are done using the Yes (a green checkmark) Reaction
  (Zoom Reactions are in the lower menu bar of your Zoom session).
  This helps us assess the optimal length of this session
- Move to the next optional exercises

### (optional) Exercise 3: using sftp

???- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Explore the UPPMAX documentation
    - Transfer files to/from Bianca using `sftp`

- Scan the content of [the UPPMAX documentation on how to use sftp to transfer data to/from Bianca](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_sftp/)
- Follow the step-by-step guide of
  [the UPPMAX documentation on how to use sftp to transfer data to/from Bianca](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_sftp/).
  There are 2 transfers described (upload versus download),
  do both
- Signal in Zoom that you have nothing left to do using the No (a red cross) Reaction.
  (Zoom Reactions are in the lower menu bar of your Zoom session).
  From now on, you may be asked to help other learners
  and its helps us assess the optimal length of this session
- Read the material for the next session. Well done!

### (optional) Exercise 4: using FileZilla

???- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Explore the UPPMAX documentation
    - Transfer files to/from Bianca using FileZilla

- Scan the content of [the UPPMAX documentation on how to use FileZilla to transfer data to/from Bianca](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_filezilla/)
- Follow the step-by-step guide of
  [the UPPMAX documentation on how to use FileZilla to transfer data to/from Bianca](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/bianca_file_transfer_using_filezilla/).
  There are 2 transfers described (upload versus download),
  do both
- Signal in Zoom that you have nothing left to do using the No (a red cross) Reaction.
  (Zoom Reactions are in the lower menu bar of your Zoom session).
  From now on, you may be asked to help other learners
  and its helps us assess the optimal length of this session
- Read the material for the next session. Well done!
