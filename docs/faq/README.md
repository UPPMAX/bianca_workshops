# Frequently Asked Questions

## When to follow the basic course

### When should I follow the basic course?

When you want to be able to work with the Bianca HPC cluster.

### When should I consider to **not** follow the basic course?

These are the reasons to consider to **not** follow the basic course:

#### Basic: Reason 1: you want to learn advanced things

When you already work with Bianca and
expect to learn new and more advanced things.

In this case, the course will go too slow for you.

However, you will probably be put to work by the teachers
to help out other learners.
If you like to test your own knowledge by teaching others,
you will likely thrive in the course.

#### Basic: Reason 2: you have social anxiety

When you have social anxiety.

In this case, the course will be too social for you.

However, in this course, it is perfectly OK to give a wrong
answer or to say 'I do not know'. This is what a former
learner had to say on this:

You are welcome to try and leave anytime you want.
The course material is made for self-study too, with videos
for all exercises.
Do fill in [the beginner course's evaluation](../beginner/evaluation.md)
or [the intermediate course's evaluation](../intermediate/evaluation.md)
when you leave early :-)

## When to follow the intermediate course

### When should I follow the intermediate course?

When you want to be able to work better with the Bianca HPC cluster.

### When should I consider to **not** follow the intermediate course?

These are the reasons to consider to **not** follow this course:

#### Intermediate: Reason 1: you want to learn the basics

When you have never worked with Bianca,
you want to learn the basics.

In this case, the course will be unsuitable for you.

Consider following the basis Bianca course.

#### Intermediate: Reason 2: you have social anxiety

When you have social anxiety.

In this case, the course will be too social for you.

However, in this course, it is perfectly OK to give a wrong
answer or to say 'I do not know'. This is what a former
learner had to say on this:

You are welcome to try and leave anytime you want.
The course material is made for self-study too, with videos
for all exercises.
Do fill in [the evaluation](../evaluation.md)
when you leave early :-)

- Find/schedule/book a room where you can talk
- Buy a simple headset

### What if I don't have a good Zoom setup? Is that OK?

No.

You will feel left out, as the course in highly interactive.
It would be weird to the other learners.

## Teaching

### Why is the course learner-centered?

Because that is good teaching.

This course defines good teaching as 'evidence-based methods to let learners
acquire new skills and the monitoring of this acquisition'.
This means that it should be observed that learners need more/less to time
to practice and following the schedule based on that. Learner-centered teaching
has an effect size from 0.36 `[Hattie ranking]`
or 0.64/0.70 `[Cornelius-White, 2007][Hattie, 2012]`.

## Website

### Why is the repository owner `UPPMAX` instead of NAISS?

Because NAISS does not have a GitHub owner page yet.
