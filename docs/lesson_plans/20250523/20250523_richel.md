I want to practice my 'Feedback' more in this course iteration.

Let's take a look at the current schedule:

When | Who  | What
-----|------|-------------------------
9:00 | R    | Introduction
9:15 | J    | GPUs
9:50 | .    | Break
10:05| P    | Transferring files
10:55| .    | Break
11:10| R    | Efficient jobs
12:00| .    | Lunch
13:00| B    | Software and packages installation
13:50| .    | Break
14:05| B    | Software and packages installation
14:55| .    | Break
15:10| R    | IDEs on Bianca
15:50| R    | Summary
15:55| R    | Evaluation
16:00| .    | END

These are my sessions:

- [ ] Introduction
- [ ] Efficient jobs
- [ ] IDEs on Bianca
- [ ] Summary
- [ ] Evaluation

From my reflection:

- [NO] I don't care about the prevaluation much: let's not
  bother the learners with it
    - I kept this in, as it is an active working form to introduce the course
- [x] I suggest to move RStudio to the Basic Bianca course
    - This will be the case :-)
- [?] I suggest to remove a link to a shared document from the course material
    - BC is OK with this
    - I estimate JY are too
    - PM uses the shared document in his material, so I keep it
- [No] I suggest a simpler schedule
    - No, this is fine :-)

We have 3 registrations so far.
We've decided to teach learner-centered.
These are the things the learners want to do:

- Recently we have applied for a project on Bianca.
  We will have some human sequencing data.
  Learning basic operations for a project
  which is listed in this course will be good for us.
- efficient file transfer between Bianca and server/local desktop,
  python usage and GPU programming in bianca
- How to submit jobs in chunks and use python/PANDAS within Bianca

## Introduction

- Go through the introduction as usual, including the exercises (~10 mins)
- Describe voting procedure: 
    - first, teachers tell why their topic is important (max 1 min per topic)
    - after all topics, we will go through the topics again
      and learners vote.
      If all learners are against a topic, we'll remove it
    - removed timeslots will be filled up with topics by request
- Do voting procedure
    - Go through all the topics, each teacher tell why this is important
      (1 min per topic)
    - Go through the topics and vote
- If topics are removed, fill up empty places with topics and teachers, e.g.
    - Python: ?BC, ?RB, ?PM, ?JY
        - If RB, then he will use [this session in the NAISS Intro to Python course](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/sessions/using_the_python_interpreter/)
    - 'Job in chunks': ?PM
    - Python `pandas`: ?BC, ?RB, ?PM
        - If RB, then he will use [the pandas introduction](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html)
