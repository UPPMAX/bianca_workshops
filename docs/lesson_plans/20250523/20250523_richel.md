I want to practice my 'Feedback' more in this course iteration.

Let's take a look at the current schedule:

When | Who  | What
-----|------|-------------------------
9:00 | R    | Introduction
9:15 | J    | GPUs
9:50 | .    | Break
10:05| P    | Transferring files
10:55| .    | Break
11:10| R    | Efficient jobs
12:00| .    | Lunch
13:00| B    | Software and packages installation
13:50| .    | Break
14:05| B    | Software and packages installation
14:55| .    | Break
15:10| R    | IDEs on Bianca
15:50| R    | Summary
15:55| R    | Evaluation
16:00| .    | END

These are my sessions:

- [ ] Introduction
- [ ] Efficient jobs
- [ ] IDEs on Bianca
- [ ] Summary
- [ ] Evaluation

From my reflection:

- [NO] I don't care about the prevaluation much: let's not
  bother the learners with it
    - I kept this in, as it is an active working form to introduce the course
- [x] I suggest to move RStudio to the Basic Bianca course
    - This will be the case :-)
- [?] I suggest to remove a link to a shared document from the course material
    - BC is OK with this
    - I estimate JY are too
    - PM uses the shared document in his material, so I keep it
- [No] I suggest a simpler schedule
    - No, this is fine :-)

So
