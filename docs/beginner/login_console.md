![The Bianca console environment](./img/bianca_console_461_x_202.png)

> The Bianca console environment

!!!- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Practice using the UPPMAX documentation

    - Understand what a prompt is
    - Understand that after login, one is on a login node
    - If needed: has installed an SSH client
        - Windows: MobaXTerm

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    - Learners have practiced using the UPPMAX documentation
    - Learners understand what a console environment is
    - Learners understand what a terminal is
    - Learners understand what a prompt is
    - Learners understand that after login, one is on a login node
    - If needed, learners have installed an SSH client
        - Windows: MobaXTerm

    Lesson plan:

    ```mermaid

      %% It took me 7 mins, here I do that time x2
      Challenge: crit, challenge, after present, 14s
      %% Here I use the same time it took me to give feedback
      Feedback: feedback, after challenge, 7s
    ```

    Prior questions:

    - What is a console environment?
    - What is a terminal?
    - What is SSH?
    - What is an SSH client?
    - Do you know any SSH clients?

## Why?

Using a terminal is powerful, where a remote desktop is clumsy.
Copy-pasting text to a terminal on the remote desktop
will quickly make you wonder if it cannot be done in a smarter way.

## A terminal and SSH clients

A terminal is a text-only program that can do many things, for example,
starting a program.
An SSH client is a program that allows you to connect to another computer.
Some SSH clients can run from a terminal or vice versa.

## Exercises

???- question "Need a video?"

    The YouTube video
    ['Intro to UPPMAX Day 1: Login via a terminal'](https://youtu.be/FUNPZHEMC2s)
    shows the solution of these exercises

Here, we log in to Bianca's console environment via a terminal.

For Mac and Windows users it will be hardest to get it working.

### Exercise 1: a terminal

Go to the UPPMAX documentation at
[https://docs.uppmax.uu.se](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se),
then answer these questions:

- Find the UPPMAX page on terminals

???- question "I cannot find it. Where is it?"

    You can find find it at <https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/terminal/>

- What is a prompt?

???- question "Answer"

    The prompt is the text at the start of the line you can type on.
    It indicates that the terminal is waiting for user input.

### Exercise 2: install an SSH client if needed

Go to the UPPMAX documentation at
[https://docs.uppmax.uu.se](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se),
then answer these questions:

- Find the UPPMAX page on SSH clients

???- question "Answer"

    You can find find it at <https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/ssh_client/>

- Try starting a terminal and type `ssh` and then enter.
  If you do not get an error message, you are lucky to have an SSH client
  installed!

???- question "How does it look like when `ssh` works?"

    Your output will look similar to this:

    ```bash
    richel@richel-N141CU:~$ ssh
    usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address]
               [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file]
               [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file]
               [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
               [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-P tag] [-p port] [-R address]
               [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
               destination [command [argument ...]]
           ssh [-Q query_option]
    ```

- If there is an error, install the recommended SSH client

### Exercise 3: login via SSH

Go to the UPPMAX documentation at
[https://docs.uppmax.uu.se](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se),
then answer these questions:

- Find the page about how to login to Bianca via SSH and a password

???- question "I cannot find it. Where is it?"

    You can find find it at
    <https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/login_bianca_console_password/>

- Log in to Bianca

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Your ouput will look similar to this:

    <!-- Indeed, line lengths beyond 80 characters -->
    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

    ```bash
    sven@richel-N141CU:~/GitHubs/uppmax_intro_day_1/docs/sessions$ ssh -X sven@Bianca.uppmax.uu.se

Welcome on a login node!

### Extra: Exercise 4: Using SSH via Rackham

???- question "(optional) 7. Exercise: login into the Bianca console environment from Bianca"

    Read [the UPPMAX documentation's 'Login to the Rackham (yes, Rackham) console environment with a password'](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/login_rackham_console_password/).

    Then, log in to the Rackham console environment.
    From there, log in to the Bianca console environment.

    Do this after having logged in to the Bianca console environment,
    as most troubleshooting occurs in that exercise.
