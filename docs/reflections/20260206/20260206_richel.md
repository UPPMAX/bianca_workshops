## 2026-02-09

I had prepared for only 15 minutes. It worked good enough.

I was happy with the part I taught at the day: there was enough time
for proper teaching.

Most of the course content was a repeat of the earlier days in the week,
which could make the course go faster.
However, most of those earlier days consisted mostly of lecturing,
which could make the course go at regular pace.

It turned out that there was not enough time for the extra content
at all: most learners did not reach using the terminal from an SSH login.

The teamplay with colleagues went OK. In one instance, a colleague
volunteered to help in breakout rooms, yet, however, left
somewhen without telling me. I can imagine this was done by a Zoom
message that never reached me, due to how Zoom works.

## Evaluation results

**All confidences**: I am happy with this pattern: my learning outcomes
did as expected.

**Average confidence per question**: I am happy with this pattern.

## Any feedback?

- The menti quiz was a nice way to solidify the concepts

Does not apply to my sessions.

- I found the class informative, and very useful.
  For someone relatively new to interacting with HPCs,
  this was difficult, but not impossible.
  When I came upon an issue, or something wasn't clear,
  the staff was helpful and patient.
  I felt comfortable to ask ""dumb"" questions."

I am happy to read this.

## Comments

- I really liked the breakout rooms,
  but it was also nice to have more like "lectures" for some topics.

This is common, that learners appreciate the variation.

- A good course with a very responsive and flexible teaching team

Great!

- Good course overall, would benefit from using
  winSCP as an alternative to FileZilla

This is on my colleagues that use Windows.

- Very good course! I was afraid that it would be to fast paced or
  hard to follow but realized that the course was mainly
  a chance to explore all the material that is already around.

Nice to hear: it is indeed supposed to be learner-centered.

- Unfortunately, I missed the info that one should create a login in advance
  and then it was to late so it could be helpful to write that in the
  SCoRe/NAISS overview with the link for the registration
  that the course requires some setup.

I can imagine: there were a lot of emails :-)

- Richèl is an enthusiastic teacher! Great work!

Yay!

- Great course as an introduction to Linux bash coding and HPC clusters use.
  Specially helpful when teachers (Richel, Björn, Jayant)
  explain things along the course material.
  The small rooms system is also good to work in teams
  to follow the instructions. 

Great!

- I think the structuring of the course can be improved.
  On the first, second and third day we already worked with HPC clusters,
  but i didn't really understand what an HPC cluster until the las day.
  Maybe first focus only on Linux coding and
  then proceed with HPC clusters and applications.

Another suggestion for the NAISS Intro Week.

- This course is very extensive and introduces you to
  advanced computational resources.
  I know feel that I know the basics of coding in Linux and that,
  with some guidance, I can find my way in order to work with a HPC cluster.
  The last day had the biggest learning outcome,
  and have made me keen to taking more courses on the topic.
  Thank you to all the teachers involved.

Great to hear that the air in the schedule paid off.

- Thank you for all of the help this week.
  It was incredibly useful for a newbie like myself trying to engage with HPCs.

Awesome!

It seems to few learners used RStudio for it to get statistical power.
Besides that, I agree with the pattern here.
