I was rather unhappy with my session:
the setup of the session is misaligned.
The question is:

- How to use resources efficiently?

The next question is:

- How to best use resources: use 1 core
- When to use more cores:
  - If it is worth it, e.g. if runtime
    can be brought under 10 days
- How to go down in resource use using jobstats

I think the session should be restructured.

Also the exercise 2 will not work for others.
