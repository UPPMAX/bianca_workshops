<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

I had prepared well, slept well and felt fine.

## First half

I needed to prepare a lesson on NAISS sens, which I just did,
after teaching from 9:00-12:00.

The teaching session went well I think, with the biggest problem at the
start. This biggest problem was an unfortunate couple in the break-out rooms,
with 1 learner having no access to Bianca, and the other learner feeling
uncomfortable with computers. It was clear in the body language of the
second, that she was agitated. I ruthlessly re-coupled these learners
with two of my UPPMAX colleagues. After 10 minutes, it was very clear
that this was the right call, which again could be seen clearly in the
body language of the second learner. This problem turned into my
favorite moment of these sessions!

I've made the console login optional, as well as using the command-line:
there was no time for this. I've seen in my last reflection:

> - [ ] Discuss either moving SSH login to the Intermediate course,
> or request 45 minutes more time

This has not happened. At least, I do not remember any meeting on the
Bianca courses. I assume that, if they took place, they took place
before/after the UPPMAX weekly meeting.

One learner did not have a good Zoom setup.
This needed not be and definitely did not help her.

- [ ] Suggest to make 'A good Zoom setup' more prominent
  in the prerequisites

The prerequisites were in a long Word document. Some learners indicated
that this was a complex document. I agree. There were no screenshots
and no video.

- [ ] Suggest to replace the prerequisites document by a page on this
  course's website and simplify

## Second half

After preparing, I came back a bit earlier
to taste the atmosphere of the course.
The learners seemed to still be in a good mood.

As an earlier session needed more time,
I had 6 minutes to teach NAISS sens and I was fine with that.
It was one session of monologue teaching, which I said would be
close to useless, but at least they've seen what to expect.

- [ ] Suggest to move console login to Intermediate course
  and/or remove 'Legal aspects of sensitive data' and/or 
  make the course end at 16:00

Evaluations went smoothly.

Q&A had 1 learner using it, hence 9% did use it. I think it can be remove.

- [ ] Suggest to remove the Q&A

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

These grades feel heigher/better than would be fair: the untaught
session got a 2.8 already. I feel some learners were a bit too
happy :-) . Let's celebrate this over criticizing this, I guess :+1:.

Maybe this worked so well, because there were so many UPPMAX colleagues...?

## Anonymous feedback

- Good course and nicely interactive with lots of time for exercises.
  I also want to thank all that were involved in
  creating the uppmax documentation,
  which is the real helper for me in the future,
  since I will probably not recall much from the course in a few months!
- The schedule and efficiency of the program was great. 
- Some of the instructions we follow were a bit unclear
  for someone who knows just a little bit.
  For example, Like creating a text file, it didn't say where you should do it.
  So i guessed. 
  But overall I really liekd the course 
    - [ ] TODO: fix this: the learner is right!
- The lectures were very informative,
  and I will be able to use a lot of the things I learned in my projects.
- Improving titles of Subsections would facilitate going through the
  documentation alone.
  For example, the title Why? is not very clear on the question itself.
  Thanks for the time, it was fun and useful.
    - [ ] TODO: reconsider using 'Why?' as a header
- Thanks to all teachers: Björn, Pavlin and Richèl!
  Nice introduction and nice interactive !!!
- Thank you for a very helpful course!
  I am very happy to have taken it and it will certainly help me.
  I would like to add, however, that I was surprised that the
  filetransfer-session was mostly about using the terminal
  (even though the course summary clearly indicated graphic file
  manager - and the terminal handling was for more advanced students).
  Also, I think it would be a good idea to tell students beforehand
  to download e.g. Filezilla or WinSCP (which I am not used to at all)
  rather than MobaXterm.
  I had no use of downloading MobaXterm (which was quite buggy to be honest)
  during the course as I was taught that you could access a terminal
  via desktop Bianca.
  These are just a few bits of feedback.
  But as I mentioned to begin with, I think you did a good job.
    - [ ] TODO: add installing FileZilla to the prereqs
- Thank you for a well structured introduction and a meaningful day!
  Regarding confidence to do things, I will still need written instructions.
  The afternoon sessions: here I spent to much time installing the "support"
  software needed and thus did not have time to try and transfer files.
  I suggest that you prepare participants even more in detail
  by adding a list on the type of software we need to do these things.
  Now I tried unsuccesfully with both FileZilla and WinSCP,
  but have some hope of managing this at some point.
  I think it worked out rather well -all in all- for me as a beginner
  and as such also a person without no prior knowledge
  or skills when it comes to scripts etc. 
- The course was amazing, thank you so much for this!
  Just a couple of corrections to the course material.
  On page:
  https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshops/beginner/file_transfer_using_gui/ 
  You say, under section '3b. Locate that file on Bianca using the graphical
  file explorer': "Its location is at
  /home/[user_name]/[project_name]/nobackup/wharf/[user_name]/[user_name]-[project_name],
  for example, at /home/sven/sens123456/nobackup/wharf/sven/sven-sens123456."
  There is no such directory.
  Then you repeat that same information under section
  '3c. Locate that file on Bianca using the terminal':
  "Its location is at 
  /home/[user_name]/[project_name]/nobackup/wharf/[user_name]/[user_name]-[project_name],
  for example, at /home/sven/sens123456/nobackup/wharf/sven/sven-sens123456."
  Again, there is no such directory.
  On page: https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshops/beginner/transfer_basics/
  You say under section '#the-wharf-location-on-bianca':
  "The path to this folder, once you are logged into your project's cluster, is:
  /proj/<projid>/nobackup/wharf/<username>/<username>-<projid>
  E.g. /proj/sens2025560/nobackup/wharf/myuser/myuser-sens2025560"
  But the real path is actually: 
  "/proj/**nobackup**/<projid>/wharf/<username>/<username>-<projid>/"
    - [x] TODO: Fix. Done!
