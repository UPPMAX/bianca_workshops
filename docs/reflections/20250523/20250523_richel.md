At the start we did a voting procedure,
as I described in the lesson plan.
I think this was clear and went well.

Topic         |Yes|No |Neutral
--------------|---|---|-------
GPU           |1  |2  |0
Transfer      |3  |0  |0
Efficient jobs|3  |0  |0
Installing    |3  |0  |0
IDEs          |2  |0  |1

We decided to keep the schedule and discussed the GPU.
A learner suggested to do other stuff wile listening in.
We followed that suggestion.

I felt better to remove the initial exercise.
BC reminded me to consider doing it, yet I felt it was better at that moment:
I felt it not important enough to delay the course even further.

We scheduled 35 minutes for GPU. The session took 17 minutes.
I suggested to schedule it at 20 minutes. JY wanted 5 more minutes
for questions, hence GPU will now be scheduled at 25 minutes.
