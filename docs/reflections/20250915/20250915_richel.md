## Earlier reflection

This was the result from an earlier reflection,
which I did not do before this course iteration:

- [ ] Take into account that the to-do 'Discuss either moving
  SSH login to the Intermediate course,
  or request 45 minutes more time' failed

## Reflection during teaching

I had a good time. The group was fun to work with.
The group members helped each other well.
I sent some people away, in mutual agreement:

- 1x no account -> will try next Bianca course again
- 3x already know login -> come back at 13:00 for file transfer

Also, before lunch, I sent around 6x learners on an early lunch.
I am happy with the amount of air in the schedule:
it will usually work for most.

- [ ] Show copy-paste of script to `nano` on Bianca live,
  to make sure learners can do so in the Slurm session

## Reflection after teaching

In the last session before the summary and evaluation, I sent learners
to evaluate and leave earlier too. I did not know the teacher of that
session wanted to do a wrap-up in the end. I accepted that the summary
would be missed by those learners and although it would impede their
learning, I felt I should not let them wait. I told the other teacher
during teacher, but he thought these were the learners that announced
to leave earlier. During the informal evaluation with the teachers,
I told this again. We seemed to agree that what I did was good enough.

I am unsure about the quality of my teaching: I have not checked
that the learners can search the UPPMAX documentation for what they need.
I have not checked if they can copy-paste scripts to Bianca.

- [ ] Ask a learner for a demo of searching the UPPMAX docs during teaching
- [ ] Consider asking a learner to show how to copy-paste text into
  a Bianca script

## Reflection on evaluation results

The evaluation was only positive: there was nothing reported to improve
upon. It seems the learners have had a good time and lost the ability
to be critical.

So, the modules section was the weakest one.

- [ ] Consider adding a demo about modules

Taking a look at the [pre-post statistics](../../evaluations/20250915/stats.md),
these are the sessions that did not increase the mean
confidence significantly:

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Also these point in the direction that the third hour
should be improved.

## Reflection conclusion

The courses has gone so well, that the learners lost their ability to
be critical. Luckily, the confidence scores help in pointing out
weaker sections.

My teaching still felt sloppy, with Feedback being the weakest. Consider adding:

- Quizzes
- Live demo
- Learner demo

I would grade my teaching a 7.5 out of 10, due to the sloppy teaching.
