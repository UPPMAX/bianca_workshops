## Earlier reflection

This was the result from an earlier reflection,
which I did not do before this course iteration:

- [ ] Take into account that the to-do 'Discuss either moving
  SSH login to the Intermediate course,
  or request 45 minutes more time' failed

## Reflection during teaching

I had a good time. The group was fun to work with.
The group members helped each other well.
I sent some people away, in mutual agreement:

- 1x no account -> will try next Bianca course again
- 3x already know login -> come back at 13:00 for file transfer

Also, before lunch, I sent around 6x learners on an early lunch.
I am happy with the amount of air in the schedule:
it will usually work for most.

- [ ] Show copy-paste of script to `nano` on Bianca live,
  to make sure learners can do so in the Slurm session
