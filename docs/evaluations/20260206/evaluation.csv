Unfortunately, I missed the info that one should create a login in advance and then it was to late so it could be helpful to write that in the SCore/NAISS overview with the link for the registration that the course requires some setup.
Richèl is an enthusiastic teacher! Great work!"

Specially helpful when teachers (Richel, Björn, Jayant) explain things along the course material. The small rooms system is also good to work in teams to follow the instructions. 
I think the structuring of the course can be improved. On the first, second and third day we already worked with HPC clusters, but i didn't really understand what an HPC cluster until the las day. Maybe first focus only on Linux coding and then proceed with HPC clusters and applications. 
This course is very extensive and introduces you to advanced computational resources. I know feel that I know the basics of coding in Linux and that, with some guidance, I can fin my way in order to work with a HPC cluster. The last day had the biggest learning outcome, and have made me keen to taking more courses on the topic. Thank you to all the teachers involved. "
