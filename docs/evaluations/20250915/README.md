Love the team's energy and teaching styles,
it made it easier to follow
even though there were different teaching styles as well.

Rich√®l was a good energetic anchor and interactive teacher,
Pavlin was a transparent teacher that encouraged extra-curricular knowledge,
and jayant was very calm and knowledgeable.
Love that he gave a summary of the course progress
before he started his section too.
