## Any other feedback?

- Perhaps provide the respective Bianca workshop links before the course
  (unless you have already done so and I missed it...),
  so one can get a bit more familiar with some terms?
  Every teacher did a good job, so no individual feedback here.
  It was rather the topics that were challenging at different levels,
  depending on the existing (or non-existing) background knowledge
  that made it easier or difficult to follow
  (hence, perhaps "force" the course participants to complete
  some reading-up before the course, or make them watch certain videos, etc.,
  that you feel are important for understanding everything).
  Could be done in the Canvas platform for example where you can also see
  if someone has not done the respective task. 
- Gentle introduction to the topics, good pace, good selection of topics.
- The course is super helpful and thanks to all the instructors!

## [Any feedback](any_feedback.cvs)

Love the team's energy and teaching styles,
it made it easier to follow
even though there were different teaching styles as well.

Richèl was a good energetic anchor and interactive teacher,
Pavlin was a transparent teacher that encouraged extra-curricular knowledge,
and jayant was very calm and knowledgeable.
Love that he gave a summary of the course progress
before he started his section too.
