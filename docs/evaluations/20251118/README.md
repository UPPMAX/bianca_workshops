## [comments.txt](comments.txt)

- Sometimes the instructions on the course page
  were a little hard to follow with a lot of pointing to other pages
  (understandable, to not have duplicate information)
  and similar information repeated (first as principles,
  then as step-by-step-instructions).
  But other than that it was a pedagogic and helpful course!
- It's a very good and detailed seminar and teachers are very nice
  and give many useful tips. Highly recommend !
