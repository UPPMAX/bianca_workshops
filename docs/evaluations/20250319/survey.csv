I would like to add, however, that I was surprised that the filetransfer-session was mostly about using the terminal (even though the course summary clearly indicated graphic file manager - and the terminal handling was for more advanced students). Also, I think it would be a good idea to tell students beforehand to download e.g. Filezilla or WinSCP (which I am not used to at all) rather than MobaXterm. I had no use of downloading MobaXterm (which was quite buggy to be honest) during the course as I was taught that you could access a terminal via desktop Bianca. These are just a few bits of feedback. But as I mentioned to begin with, I think you did a good job."

Regarding confidence to do things, I will still need written instructions. The afternoon sessions: here I spent to much time installing the ""support"" software needed and thus did not have time to try and transfer files. I suggest that you prepare participants even more in detail by adding a list on the type of software we need to do these things. Now I tried unsuccesfully with both FileZilla and Win SCP, but have some hope of managing this at some point. I think it worked out rather well -all in all- for me as a beginner and as such also a person without no prior knowledge or skills when it comes to scripts etc. "

On page:
https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshops/beginner/file_transfer_using_gui/

You say, under section '3b. Locate that file on Bianca using the graphical file explorer':
""Its location is at /home/[user_name]/[project_name]/nobackup/wharf/[user_name]/[user_name]-[project_name], for example, at /home/sven/sens123456/nobackup/wharf/sven/sven-sens123456.""

There is no such directory.

Then you repeat that same information under section '3c. Locate that file on Bianca using the terminal':
""Its location is at /home/[user_name]/[project_name]/nobackup/wharf/[user_name]/[user_name]-[project_name], for example, at /home/sven/sens123456/nobackup/wharf/sven/sven-sens123456.""

Again, there is no such directory.

On page:
https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshops/beginner/transfer_basics/

You say under section '#the-wharf-location-on-bianca':
""The path to this folder, once you are logged into your project's cluster, is:

/proj/<projid>/nobackup/wharf/<username>/<username>-<projid> E.g. /proj/sens2025560/nobackup/wharf/myuser/myuser-sens2025560""

But the real path is actually:
""/proj/**nobackup**/<projid>/wharf/<username>/<username>-<projid>/"""
