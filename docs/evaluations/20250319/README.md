## Anonymous feedback

- Good course and nicely interactive with lots of time for exercises.
  I also want to thank all that were involved in
  creating the uppmax documentation,
  which is the real helper for me in the future,
  since I will probably not recall much from the course in a few months!
- The schedule and efficiency of the program was great. 
- Some of the instructions we follow were a bit unclear
  for someone who knows just a little bit.
  For example, Like creating a text file, it didn't say where you should do it.
  So i guessed. But overall I really liekd the course 
- The lectures were very informative,
  and I will be able to use a lot of the things I learned in my projects.
- Improving titles of Subsections would facilitate going through the
  documentation alone.
  For example, the title Why? is not very clear on the question itself.
  Thanks for the time, it was fun and useful.
- Thanks to all teachers: Björn, Pavlin and Richèl!
  Nice introduction and nice interactive !!!
- Thank you for a very helpful course!
  I am very happy to have taken it and it will certainly help me.
  I would like to add, however, that I was surprised that the
  filetransfer-session was mostly about using the terminal
  (even though the course summary clearly indicated graphic file
  manager - and the terminal handling was for more advanced students).
  Also, I think it would be a good idea to tell students beforehand
  to download e.g. Filezilla or WinSCP (which I am not used to at all)
  rather than MobaXterm.
  I had no use of downloading MobaXterm (which was quite buggy to be honest)
  during the course as I was taught that you could access a terminal
  via desktop Bianca.
  These are just a few bits of feedback.
  But as I mentioned to begin with, I think you did a good job.
- Thank you for a well structured introduction and a meaningful day!
  Regarding confidence to do things, I will still need written instructions.
  The afternoon sessions: here I spent to much time installing the "support"
  software needed and thus did not have time to try and transfer files.
  I suggest that you prepare participants even more in detail
  by adding a list on the type of software we need to do these things.
  Now I tried unsuccesfully with both FileZilla and WinSCP,
  but have some hope of managing this at some point.
  I think it worked out rather well -all in all- for me as a beginner
  and as such also a person without no prior knowledge
  or skills when it comes to scripts etc. 
- The course was amazing, thank you so much for this!
  Just a couple of corrections to the course material.
  On page:
  https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshops/beginner/file_transfer_using_gui/ 
  You say, under section '3b. Locate that file on Bianca using the graphical
  file explorer': "Its location is at
  /home/[user_name]/[project_name]/nobackup/wharf/[user_name]/[user_name]-[project_name],
  for example, at /home/sven/sens123456/nobackup/wharf/sven/sven-sens123456."
  There is no such directory.
  Then you repeat that same information under section
  '3c. Locate that file on Bianca using the terminal':
  "Its location is at 
  /home/[user_name]/[project_name]/nobackup/wharf/[user_name]/[user_name]-[project_name],
  for example, at /home/sven/sens123456/nobackup/wharf/sven/sven-sens123456."
  Again, there is no such directory.
  On page: https://uppmax.github.io/bianca_workshops/beginner/transfer_basics/
  You say under section '#the-wharf-location-on-bianca':
  "The path to this folder, once you are logged into your project's cluster, is:
  /proj/<projid>/nobackup/wharf/<username>/<username>-<projid>
  E.g. /proj/sens2025560/nobackup/wharf/myuser/myuser-sens2025560"
  But the real path is actually: 
  "/proj/**nobackup**/<projid>/wharf/<username>/<username>-<projid>/"
